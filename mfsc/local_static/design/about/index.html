      <p>With the completion of the Massachusetts Local Food Action Plan, a group of stakeholder organizations are forming a collaborative to work toward making some of the key recommendations in the Plan a reality. Members of the Executive Committee that led the planning process are forming a Steering Committee for a new Massachusetts Food System Collaborative (MFSC), which will be guided by an Advisory Committee composed of many of the Plan’s current Project Advisors.</p>

      <p>The Collaborative will focus on the four main goals of the Plan:
      
      <ul>
        <li>Increase production, sales and consumption of Massachusetts-grown foods.</li>

        <li>Create jobs and economic opportunity in food, farming and fishing, and improve the wages and skills of food system workers.</li>

        <li>Protect the land and water needed to produce food, maximize environmental benefits from agriculture and fishing, and ensure food safety.</li>

        <li>Reduce hunger and food insecurity, increase the availability of healthy food to all residents, and reduce food waste.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Projects led by the Collaborative will bring together nonprofit trade and advocacy groups, businesses, academics, policymakers, and regulators, to further policy recommendations toward these goals. The Collaborative will work closely with the Massachusetts Food Policy Council, the Massachusetts legislature, and other public and private bodies that will also be working toward the goals of the Plan.</p>

      <p>If you'd like to be kept informed about the Collaborative's activities, email Director Winton Pitcoff.</p>
