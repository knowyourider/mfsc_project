        <p>Land is agriculture’s foundational infrastructure, and most farmers' primary asset. Accordingly, property taxes and land use regulations and programs play a large role in farm profitability and business viability. The State’s Chapter 61A program is an important tool, offering reduced property taxes on land in active agricultural use in recognition of the benefits it provides and the fewer municipal services it requires. And, as stated previously, the State’s Agricultural Preservation Restriction (APR) program is also a vitally important tool and accounts for approximately 71,000 acres of the 74,122 total acres of permanently protected farmland statewide, keeping the land in production and more affordable for current and future farmers.[1] Three other State programs – the Farm Viability Enhancement Program (FVEP), the APR Improvement Program (AIP), and the Matching Enterprise for Agriculture (MEGA) Program – provide business planning, technical assistance, and grants to help improve the productivity and profitability of Massachusetts farms.</p>

        <details>
          <summary class="read-more">more....</summary>
        
          <p>These programs are valuable and necessary to keep land in farming and farmers on the land, but policy challenges and gaps remain. In the case of Chapter 61A, municipalities are allowed to set their own land valuations rather than those set by the State. Some municipalities that have chosen to do so have used rates based on farmland sales rather than farmland use, resulting in significant property tax increases for some farmers.[2] Farms which have retail operations or process their farm products on-farm rely on buildings as much as land for their operations to be financially viable. Yet unlike land, tax laws do not recognize this and farmers often face debilitating tax bills on buildings. Relatedly, where State law allows towns to vote to exempt farm equipment and animals on non-incorporated farms from excise tax, this provision does not extend to incorporated farms. Yet many family farms incorporate to protect their homes and personal assets from liability. Additionally, some communities charge farmers stormwater and flood water utility fees, which can range from relatively small for farmland to significant for farm buildings, and can include land eligible for Chapter 61A.</p>

      <ol class="rec-menu">
        <li><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="expander-trigger expander-hidden">1.1 Reduce the municipal tax burden on farms.</a>

          <ol class="expander-content">
            <li><a href="action-1-1-1.html">1.1.1 Enact legislation that provides a tax credit for agricultural buildings, exempting new or reconstructed agricultural buildings essential to a farm operation from local property taxes for a period of 10 years, provided the building remains in agricultural use.</a></li>

            <li><a href="">1.1.2 Expand current law that allows towns to vote to waive excise tax on farm animals and equipment to include incorporated farming operations.</a></li>

            <li><a href="">1.1.3 Enact legislation to exempt farmland eligible for Chapter 61A from municipal storm or floodwater fees.</a></li>

            <li><a href="">1.1.4 To address concerns over potential loss of revenue to rural communities, explore ways to provide financial incentives to communities that enact farm-friendly zoning and tax policies, including through the Baker Administration’s Commonwealth Compact initiative.</a></li>

            <li><a href="">1.2.1 Modify Chapter 61A to direct the Farmland Valuation Advisory Commission to guide and limit municipalities setting their own farmland values, to ensure that values are based on use value, not sales value. The University of Massachusetts’ Department of Resource Economics should provide increased resources and expertise to the Farmland Valuation Advisory Committee in evaluating and updating farmland values across the Commonwealth.</a></li>

            <li><a href="">1.2.2 Develop 61A valuation for forestland where trees are tapped for maple products.</a></li>

            <li>1.7.2 Advocate for federal crop insurance products that would cover the loss of fruit trees and other perennial crops in the event of vandalism, flooding, wildlife, or other damage not covered by existing crop insurance policies.</li>
